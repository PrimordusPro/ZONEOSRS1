# My old school RuneScape bot.

This bot will drink overload,  super combat, divine super combat, prayer, restore and absorption potions for you when needed at nightmare zone.
The bot will only start running once it's inside of the nightmare zone.

## Known bug:

When you open or close the SideBar, the plugin stops working and has to be restarted.

## Missing functionality (no longer in development):
Auto banking and nightmare zone game starting.

```Works only in fixed mode. Feel free to add other resolution modes (only a few lines)```
